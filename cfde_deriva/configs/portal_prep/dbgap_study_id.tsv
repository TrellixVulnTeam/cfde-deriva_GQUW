L1 moves throughout the genome via a copy-and-paste mechanism termed retrotransposition. L1 retrotransposition also mobilizes other cellular  RNAs such as SINES, U6 snRNA and, mRNA, which for the latter results in the formation of processed pseudogenes. In this study we demonstrate that the

phs001944	Contamination of Hep2 Clone 2B Cells by HeLa Cells and the Bxv1    Retrovirus	We have sequenced DNA and RNA from the Hep2 (clone 2B) cell line (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number: 85011412-1VL) using short read illumina sequencing. We show that this cell line is indistinguishable  from the HeLa cell line (as mentioned on the Sigma-Aldrich website) by mapping integrations of the human papillomavirus 18. We also show that the
phs002014	High Resolution Analysis of Spatial Interactions of Hundreds of Promoters    in HeLa Cells	In this study we developed a new hybridisation-based promoter Capture-C protocol that makes use of biotinylated dsDNA probes and allows high-resolution promoter interactome description. Experiments aimed to describe spatial interactions  of set of 861 promoters were performed in HeLa cells. We have found that enrichment efficiency and quality of final libraries in our study is on a
phs002074	Gene Therapy Normalizes the IgH Repertoire in ADA Deficiency	Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) through an accumulation of toxic metabolites within lymphocytes. Recently, ADA deficiency has been successfully treated using lentiviral-transduced autologous CD34+ cells carrying  the ADA gene. T and B cell function appears to be fully restored but in many patients' B cell numbers remain low and assessments of the
phs002099	Systematic Analysis of Transcription Program Regulation by Transcription    Factor EB (TFEB)	In order to evaluate the effects of TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, CRISPR-Cas9 TFEB knock out cell lines were generated and reconstituted with wild-type TFEB (TFEB-WT),  a vector control (TFEB-KO) or TFEB engineered to remain localized to the cytosol (TFEB-cyto) or to the nucleus (TFEB-nuc). RNA sequencing was
phs002636	NABEC Whole-Genome Sequencing	NABEC whole-genome DNA sequencing was done in 354 neurologically normal control samples deposited in North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC). The DNA comes from brain tissue. The whole-genome sequencing data  was generated and provided by the laboratory of Neurogenetics, NIA, NIH. Principal Investigator: Andrew B. Singleton, PhD, Center for Alzheimer
phs002794	Immunobiology and Natural History of Human Infection with Agent of Lyme    Disease, Borrelia burgdorferi	The overall objective of this study is to measure risk factors, symptom patterns and severity, longitudinal course, and associated biomarkers in patients who develop symptoms of post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD)  in a prospective cohort study. Phenotype data will be provided in the publication&#x02019;s supplemental materials. This dataset was used to develop
